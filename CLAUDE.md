# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Holo RSS Reader is a Python RSS/Atom feed reader designed for OpenClaw skill deployment. It fetches feeds concurrently, generates daily digest markdown, caches full articles, and supports importing subscriptions from GitHub Gist OPML files.

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests

# Run a single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_fetcher.py

# Run a single test case
uv run pytest tests/test_fetcher.py::TestFetchFeed::test_fetch_rss_feed_success

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=html

# Run the app (via OpenClaw deployment script)
bash scripts/rss.sh fetch|list|doctor|read|import|today|history|full
```

Python 3.11+ required. Uses `uv` as the package manager.

## Architecture

All source code lives in `scripts/`. Entry point is `scripts/main.py` which defines 8 CLI commands (`import`, `read`, `list`, `fetch`, `today`, `history`, `full`, `doctor`).

**Data flow for `fetch` command (the primary operation):**
`main.py` → `feeds.py` (collect feeds from Gist OPML + local feeds.json) → `fetcher.py` (concurrent fetch with ThreadPoolExecutor) → `parser.py` (extract articles) → `store.py` (update state, write digest)

**Key modules:**
- `config.py` — Loads/validates config from `$RSS_DATA_DIR/config.json` with deep merge against defaults and range clamping
- `http_client.py` — Connection-pooled HTTP with retry, size limits, encoding detection, proxy fallback. Returns `HTTPResult` dataclass
- `fetcher.py` — Feed fetching with conditional requests (ETag/Last-Modified). Returns `FeedFetchMeta` alongside articles
- `feeds.py` — Merges Gist OPML feeds with local `feeds.json`, deduplicates by URL
- `gist.py` — Extracts Gist IDs from various URL formats, fetches OPML via GitHub API, parses with defusedxml
- `parser.py` — Extracts articles from feedparser entries, truncates summaries at sentence boundaries (CJK-aware)
- `store.py` — JSON-based state management with atomic writes (temp file + rename). Tracks seen URLs, generates daily digest .md/.json, caches full articles indexed by SHA256
- `url_validator.py` — Three security modes: `loose` (scheme only), `restricted` (blocks private IPs), `allowlist` (explicit hostnames)
- `exit_codes.py` — Constants: OK=0, PARAM_ERROR=2, NETWORK_ERROR=3, PARSE_ERROR=4, STORAGE_ERROR=5

**Storage layout** (default `~/data/rss/`):
- `state.json` — Per-feed tracking: seen URLs (max 500), ETag, last_modified, consecutive failures
- `digest.md` / `digest.json` — Daily digest files
- `articles/` — Cached full articles as .md, indexed by `full_index.json`
- `config.json` — User configuration

## Key Patterns

- **Error propagation:** Functions return `(result, error_kind, error_message)` tuples. Detailed variants suffixed `*_detailed`.
- **Atomic file writes:** All state/digest writes use temp file + `os.rename`.
- **Conditional requests:** ETag/Last-Modified persisted per feed in state.json to return 304 on unchanged feeds.
- **Thread safety:** `cmd_fetch` uses locks for state and results during concurrent fetching with checkpoint saves every 20 feeds.
- **Graceful degradation:** Corrupt config/state files → backup to `.corrupt` and start fresh with defaults.

## Testing

Uses pytest with `responses` library for HTTP mocking. Fixtures in `fixtures/` (sample RSS, OPML, Gist JSON). 25 test files organized by module with >90% coverage target. CI runs on Python 3.11 and 3.12.

## Environment Variables

- `RSS_DATA_DIR` — Storage root (default: `~/data/rss`)
- `RSS_CONFIG` — Config file path (alternative to `--config`)
- `RSS_PYTHON` — Python interpreter override for OpenClaw deployment
