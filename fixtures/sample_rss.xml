      <title>HTML Heavy Article</title>
      <link>https://example.com/html-heavy</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="post"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>This is a very long article with lots of HTML markup. It covers many topics in great detail. The first paragraph sets the stage for what follows.</p><p>The second paragraph continues with more information. It provides additional context and background. This helps readers understand the full picture.</p><p>The third paragraph goes even deeper. It explores nuances and edge cases. Many interesting points are raised here. The discussion is thorough and comprehensive. Additional sentences pad this out to be quite long indeed, exceeding our target length of four hundred characters by a comfortable margin so we can test truncation behavior properly.</p></div>]]></description>
